# Project26
Hello <s>World</s> Github!

This is the first week of Project 26, where I am learning to use GitHub from the docs - the proper way.

You can see that I already have some repositories, but those are simply just coding practices that I worked on local folder then uploading it when I'm done - so not using any git commands.

Why naming it Project 26? Because 2 times 13 is 26, and 52 divided by 2 is 26.

Oh, and I'm 26 this year. So let's get started.
